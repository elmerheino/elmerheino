## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### [Partial Dislocations](https://github.com/elmerheino/project1](https://github.com/elmerheino/partial-dislocations)
Python code for numerically solving the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson equation, a stochastic PDE that describes interface growth. Paralellization is exntensivery used to leverage all available resources when running the code on a supercomputer.

### [Minesweeper](https://github.com/elmerheino/project2](https://github.com/elmerheino/minesweeper)
A simple minesweeper game programmed in C++ and SDL2 to showcase my solid skills in
